## Plot

Geraldine Ferraro woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After her typical breakfast of toast and an egg she left for school.
Normally Geraldine Ferraro would have walked down Bleaker Street, but today there was construction and she decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of Geraldine Ferraro's specialities, and today would prove to be no different.
As she walked slowly behind the zoo, she could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo. She could hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
Geraldine Ferraro had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephantâ€™s trumpet.
She stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally Geraldine Ferraro would leave well enough alone, but she was worried that an animal might escape.
She stuck her head in the door. The color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse. She called out for a zookeeper. 
A middle-aged woman jumped out from behind the shingletail lizard exhibit, in Geraldine Ferraro's peripheral vision. Relieved, Geraldine Ferraro greeted the zookeeper. 
The zookeeper, for her part, acknowledged the time of day. It was the off-season, and the park was currently closed on Wednesdays. "You must leave the premises immediately, I'm afraid," the woman explained. 
"I'm sorry, you must be confused. I'm just trying to get to school," Geraldine Ferraro replied hastily, speedwalking down the street away from this strangely standoffish zookeeper. What was her deal, anyway? Geraldine thought as she turned the corner. 
But as she turned the corner, something reached out to Geraldine from beyond this realm. Something that felt, even sounded like a whisper crossed her mind, and she stopped dead in her tracks. 
"Come back," the voice called out hauntingly from within her subconscious. It was then that she understood what she must do. Turning slowly back around the corner, she looked around sneakily for the woman who had confronted her before. Finding no sign of her, she crept up slowly to the door. 
Stepping back into the zoo, she looked up and out across the back section of this place and its myriad reptile exhibits. Above and across the room, hung on the far wall, was a clock. The sight of what time it was slapped Geraldine Ferraro with recognition. It was 11:37, and her class had surely started without her by now. 
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
She took a tentative step further through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.
Geraldine Ferraro met the Unicorn King who vanquished the zookeeper and granted her magic powers.
The end.
