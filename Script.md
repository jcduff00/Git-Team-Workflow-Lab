## Plot

Geraldine Ferraro woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After her typical breakfast of toast and an egg she left for school.
Normally Geraldine Ferraro would have walked down Bleaker Street, but today there was construction and she decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of Geraldine Ferraro's specialities, and today would prove to be no different.
As she walked slowly behind the zoo, she could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo. She could hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
Geraldine Ferraro had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephantâ€™s trumpet.
She stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally Geraldine Ferraro would leave well enough alone, but she was worried that an animal might escape.
She stuck her head in the door. The color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse. She called out for a zookeeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
She took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

Geraldine Ferraro met the Unicorn King who granted her magic powers.
The end.
